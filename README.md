What is Stock Fundamental Analysis?
Stock fundamental analysis is a method used to assess the intrinsic value and financial health of a company using quantitative metrics derived from its financial statements. By understanding key ratios, you can filter out overvalued stocks, seek undervalued gems, and build a more confident investment thesis.
